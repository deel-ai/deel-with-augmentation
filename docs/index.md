    <b>DEEL With Augmentation</b> is a PyTorch library which implements several ML techniques to generatively augment the data and that analyzes those methods from a Fairness perspective.
</p>

This library includes two types of ML approaches to generate synthetic data to augment your training dataset: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Style Transfer (ST).

The main focus of this work is to analyze the ability of those methods to efficiently adress bias issues. More specifically, we wanted to check that augmenting a minority group (*i.e.* a group that is under represented) with those approaches could alleviate the drop in performance for the sensitive group that is usually observable when training a model on the unaugmented dataset. We made a number of experiments on the EuroSat dataset where the minority group is the satellite images with a *blue veil* and on the CelebA dataset on which multiple minority groups could be defined.

## üêç The Augmentation Package

In this repository we packaged all the code used for our experiments to allow both: reproducibility and usability as a Python package of the augmentation methods.
